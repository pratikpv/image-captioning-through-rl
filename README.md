# Image captioning using Deep Reinforcement Learning

* Implementation of <code> Zhou, R., Wang, X., Zhang, N., Lv, X., & Li-Jia, L. (2017). Deep Reinforcement Learning-based Image Captioning with Embedding Reward. ArXiv.org, Apr 12, 2017. </code>
* We used Advantage Actor Critic (A2C) Model to train the Policy network and the value network.
* Also experimented with curriculum learning-based approaches.
* Project completed as part of Reinforcement Learning class at SJSU, Spring 2020
